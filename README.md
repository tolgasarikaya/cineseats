This project is a frontend application developed using the Next.js framework. Current movies in theaters and upcoming releases are fetched from the TMDB (The Movie Database) database. The application allows users to make cinema ticket reservations for their selected movies. Currently, API integrations are not completed and are still in the development phase.
